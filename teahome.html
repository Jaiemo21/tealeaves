          The leaves pictures can be used for the prediction of various tea leaves Diseases which 
          causes huge lose in agricultural system every year. The proposed system -Tea leaves image processing system helps to the analysis 
          of leaves and thereby help us in predicting various leaves diseases. The input to the proposed 
          system is the Tea leaves images. The leaves portion is segmented and leaves cour, shape and 
          texture features are extracted and taken together to form a feature vector and then analysis of leaves are done wich is used for the diagnosis of
          varous tea leaves diseases. Tis proposed system will help the farmers in the early diagnosis of diseases.
